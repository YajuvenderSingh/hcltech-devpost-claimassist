# NMM Flow - Corrections Applied ✅

## 🔧 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

### **1. Field Name Alignment**
- ✅ Changed `claimid` → `indexid` in orchestration service
- ✅ Updated AWS service to use `indexid` for extraction lambda
- ✅ Fixed payload format consistency across all services

### **2. S3 Path Corrections**
- ✅ Updated S3 paths to use `newmexicomutual/claimforms/` format
- ✅ Aligned UI upload paths with extraction lambda expectations
- ✅ Added proper fallback path generation

### **3. Lambda Integration**
- ✅ Updated AWS service to use `nmm-orchestration-lambda`
- ✅ Fixed payload structure for SQS message format
- ✅ Ensured proper field mapping throughout the chain

### **4. Error Handling**
- ✅ Added fallback values for missing fields
- ✅ Improved S3 path generation with proper structure
- ✅ Enhanced payload validation

## 📊 **CORRECTED FLOW:**

```
UI Upload → Orchestration → SQS → Extraction → Classification → Entity → Confidence
    ✅           ✅         ✅        ✅           ✅              ✅        ✅
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULTS:**

### **Before Fixes:**
- ❌ `KeyError: 'indexid'` in extraction lambda
- ❌ `InvalidS3ObjectException` - file not found
- ❌ Processing chain stopped at extraction

### **After Fixes:**
- ✅ Proper `indexid` field sent to extraction lambda
- ✅ Correct S3 paths: `newmexicomutual/claimforms/IN123/DOC456/file.pdf`
- ✅ Processing chain should continue through all lambdas

## 🚀 **STATUS: FULLY CORRECTED**

All identified issues have been fixed:
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Field mappings corrected
- ✅ S3 paths aligned
- ✅ Lambda integration updated

**Ready for end-to-end testing with real document uploads.**
